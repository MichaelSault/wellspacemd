                            We have implemented several strategies to help limit the spread of COVID-19.  Some but not all of these activities include actively screening 
                            all patients by phone or email prior to arrival for COVID-19 symptoms, asking patients to wait outside our suite or in the parking lot and until 
                            an exam room is ready for them to be immediately placed into, regular cleaning & disinfecting of commonly touched surfaces in our exam rooms and 
                            common spaces, restricting in office visits to essential health care visits that are not adequately assessed by phone or video call, screening 
                            our own staff for COVID-19 symptoms on a daily basis, asking our staff to wear appropriate PPE in patient exposed areas, etc.
